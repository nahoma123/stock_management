# Odoo SaaS Platform: Detailed Project Plan & Roadmap

**Role:** Project Manager
**Date:** 2025-08-15

This document provides a granular breakdown of the tasks required to evolve the Odoo SaaS platform from a Proof of Concept into a production-ready, commercially viable, and extensible product.

## 1. Core Platform: Odoo SaaS

### Phase 1: Stabilize the Core (Immediate Priority)

This phase is critical to create a stable foundation. The goal is to make the existing PoC reliable.

- **Task: Debug `saas_management_tools` Addon**
    - **Sub-Task:** Analyze the server logs to identify the root cause of the activation error.
    - **Sub-Task:** Fix the identified error (this could be a dependency issue, a code error, or a data model conflict).
    - **Sub-Task:** Verify that the addon can be installed, upgraded, and uninstalled without errors.

- **Task: Refactor Database Provisioning**
    - **Sub-Task:** Add the `psycopg2-binary` package to the `Dockerfile.odoo` requirements.
    - **Sub-Task:** Create a new utility module (e.g., `db_manager.py`) within the `saas_management_tools` addon.
    - **Sub-Task:** Implement `create_database(db_name)` and `drop_database(db_name)` functions in `db_manager.py` using `psycopg2`.
    - **Sub-Task:** Replace the `subprocess` calls in `saas_tenant.py` with calls to the new `db_manager` functions.
    - **Sub-Task:** Implement robust error handling and logging for all database operations.

- **Task: Secure Credential Management**
    - **Sub-Task:** Remove all hardcoded passwords from Python files (`saas_tenant.py`, etc.).
    - **Sub-Task:** Modify the Docker Compose file to pass all secrets (database passwords, master passwords) as environment variables.
    - **Sub-Task:** Update the Python code to read these secrets from the environment (`os.environ.get(...)`).
    - **Sub-Task:** Create a `.env.example` file for developers, documenting all required environment variables.

### Phase 2: Build Production-Ready Features

- **Task: Implement a Robust Job Queue**
    - **Sub-Task:** Refactor the tenant creation logic in `saas_tenant.py` to use Odoo's `@job` decorator.
    - **Sub-Task:** Configure Odoo's background workers in the production `odoo.conf` and Docker setup.
    - **Sub-Task:** Create a UI view in the SaaS Management app to monitor the status of background jobs (queued, running, failed).

- **Task: Complete Tenant Lifecycle Management**
    - **Sub-Task:** Add `action_deactivate_tenant` and `action_delete_tenant` methods to the `saas.tenant` model.
    - **Sub-Task:** The deactivate action should disable the tenant's database but not delete it.
    - **Sub-Task:** The delete action should trigger a background job to drop the tenant's database using the `db_manager`.
    - **Sub-Task:** Add corresponding buttons to the `saas_tenant` form view with confirmation dialogs.

- **Task: Automate Multi-Company Setup**
    - **Sub-Task:** Add an option to the `tenant.creation.wizard` to enable multi-company support.
    - **Sub-Task:** Extend the tenant provisioning logic to install the necessary Odoo modules for multi-company and configure it post-installation.

### Phase 3: Go Live Infrastructure

- **Task: Implement Reverse Proxy & SSL**
    - **Sub-Task:** Add a new service to `docker-compose.yml` for a reverse proxy (e.g., Traefik).
    - **Sub-Task:** Configure the proxy to route requests based on hostnames (e.g., `superadmin.yourdomain.com`, `tenant1.yourdomain.com`).
    - **Sub-Task:** Configure the proxy to automatically manage SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
    - **Sub-Task:** Create documentation on how to configure DNS for new tenants.

- **Task: Enhance POS Offline Capabilities**
    - **Sub-Task:** Create a `manifest.json` and a service worker (`sw.js`) for the POS module.
    - **Sub-Task:** Add the necessary code to register the service worker and make the POS a fully compliant PWA.
    - **Sub-Task:** Thoroughly test offline functionality: creating orders, customer management, and syncing upon reconnection.

## 2. External Platforms & Integrations Roadmap

- **Task: Integrate Subscription Billing (e.g., Stripe)**
    - **Sub-Task:** Install or create an Odoo module for Stripe integration.
    - **Sub-Task:** Create product and subscription plan models in the superadmin database.
    - **Sub-Task:** Build a customer portal where tenants can select a plan, enter payment details, and view their subscription status.
    - **Sub-Task:** Create webhooks to handle payment events (e.g., successful payment, failed payment) and update the tenant's state accordingly.

- **Task: Integrate Transactional Email Service (e.g., SendGrid)**
    - **Sub-Task:** Configure Odoo's mail servers to use the chosen provider's SMTP or API credentials.
    - **Sub-Task:** Test all outbound email types (welcome, password reset, etc.) to ensure reliable delivery.

## 3. Architecture & Extensibility

Following these principles will ensure the platform is ready for future extension.

- **Principle: Modular, API-First Design**
    - **Action:** For any new feature (like the Mobile App), first define the Odoo API endpoints. Keep the frontend and backend logic separate.
    - **Benefit:** Allows for multiple frontends (web, mobile) and easier integration with other systems.

- **Principle: Comprehensive Automated Testing**
    - **Action:** For every new feature or bug fix in a custom addon, write corresponding unit or integration tests.
    - **Benefit:** Prevents regressions and allows for confident refactoring.

- **Principle: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
    - **Action:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions).
    - **Benefit:** Automates testing and deployment, leading to faster and more reliable releases.
    - **Tasks:**
        - [ ] Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push/pull request.
        - [ ] The workflow should run all automated tests.
        - [ ] The workflow should build Docker images.
        - [ ] (Optional) Add a step for automatic deployment to a staging or production environment.

- **Principle: Thorough Documentation**
    - **Action:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for both developers and administrators.
    - **Benefit:** Reduces onboarding time and makes the system easier to manage.

By following this more detailed plan, you will not only finish the required features but also build a high-quality, stable, and extensible platform ready for growth.
